# Berkay's Data Visualizer


## Project Summary:
    This project is a basic data visualizer with login system and GUI. It runs on local
    database. It hashes the user data so even if someone gets the database no personal 
    information will get leaked. It allows users to make as many drafts as they want.
    Users can delete and edit the old drafts.

## Instructions:
 1. Be sure that you meet the requirements. Program works on Python version 3.9
 2. Run main.py
 3. You should see a login page. If it is the first time you are running the program,
go ahead and create an account by determining an username and password. After you enter those
click register and log in by  entering same username and password again.
4. After you log in, you will see the main menu. You can add a new file or a new function that you want to visualize by clicking on to
respective buttons.
5. After you configure your draft, you can move on to the old files menu. From there you can delete/edit or visualize it.
